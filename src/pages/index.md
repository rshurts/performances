# Support During COVID-19

The world needs beauty in order not to sink into despair. Please consider a donation of any amount to help us keep the lights on and cover basic expenses during the coronavirus crisis so we can once again gather people this fall for **Season 7** at the new Open Window Theatre. Thank you!

# Become a COR Patron

COR Patrons are monthly sustaining donors who are the "cor" (heart) of what we do. COR Patrons are thanked with complimentary season tickets, exclusive invite-only cultural events, 50%-off tickets to our ANIMA Cultural Series, a free t-shirt, and free tea and coffee on every visit!
